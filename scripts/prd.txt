# Blaze Documentation App Product Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the specifications for Blaze, a modern documentation application designed to provide developers and teams with an intuitive, fast, and feature-rich platform for organizing and accessing technical documentation. This document serves as a comprehensive guide for the development team, stakeholders, and quality assurance teams to ensure successful delivery of the product.

The document defines the functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, technical specifications, and design guidelines necessary to build a robust documentation platform that meets the needs of technical users while maintaining excellent performance and user experience standards.

## 2. Product overview

Blaze is a next-generation documentation application built as a single-page application (SPA) that provides seamless navigation through technical content. The platform leverages modern web technologies to deliver a fast, responsive, and user-friendly experience for accessing documentation.

The application features a persistent sidebar navigation system that allows users to browse through hierarchical documentation topics and subtopics efficiently. Content is rendered using MDX, supporting rich text formatting, code syntax highlighting, images, and interactive elements. The platform is designed with performance in mind, utilizing static site generation and optimized loading strategies to ensure rapid content delivery.

Key differentiators include Algolia-powered global search capabilities, smooth page transitions, modular component architecture, and support for both public and private content access control.
